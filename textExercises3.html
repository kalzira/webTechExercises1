		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A paragraph (from the Ancient Greek παράγραφος paragraphos, "to write beside" or "written beside") is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences.[1] Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In word processing and desktop publishing, a hard return or paragraph break indicates a new paragraph, to be distinguished from the soft return at the end of a line internal to a paragraph. This distinction allows word wrap to automatically re-flow text as it is edited, without losing paragraph breaks. The software may apply vertical whitespace or indenting at paragraph breaks, depending on the selected style.
